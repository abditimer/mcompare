<h1>MCompare</h1>
<h4>Open Source Machine learning Model Wrapper & Comparison Tool</h4>
MCompare (Model Compare) is an easy way to track experiments relating to your Machine Learning Models.

<h3>What is MCompare?</h3>
MCompare is a python package that simplifies the data science process. It enables for quick comparison between models, the ability to track all the relevant artifacts relating to an experiment and providing all the extra functionality required to understand more about models (e.g. Learning Charts).

<h3>What does MCompare contain?</h3>  

* Wrapper for Classification and Regression models
* Track the data used within each iteration for a model
* Compare metrics related to different models
* Track your metrics related to your experiment
* Visualise confusion matrix
* Plot learning curves, ROCAUC charts and more

<h3>Limitations</h3>  
This work was some of the baseline work which was developed for a project for one of my clients. This only has some of the basic functionality, with some aspects missing as that is IP for my client. Contact me to learn more.

<h3>How to install</h3>
